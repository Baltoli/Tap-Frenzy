# Tap-Frenzy
This was the very first app I ever completed when I started out as an iOS developer in 2012.
It's strange looking back at how much I've learned in less than 3 years (and how much I still have to learn).
I'm keeping this on GitHub for preservation purposes, not to showcase the code (it's awful).

Enjoy.
